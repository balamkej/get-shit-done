This is haskell fork of github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done, "an easy to use command line program that blocks websites known to distract us from our work." 

I've spiced it up with some new arguments to view, edit, and delete domains from the blacklist. 

It's currently set up to play well with dnsmasq on linux os x. It would be trivial to change the hosts variable to your /etc/hosts and disable the function resetting the dns server.
